Forest Cover Type Classification
This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Path.

The goal is to classify forest cover types using the UCI Covertype dataset, which contains environmental and cartographic variables like elevation, slope, and soil type.

Models Used
Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Tasks Performed
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Train-test split

Model training and prediction

Accuracy evaluation

Confusion matrix visualization

Feature importance analysis

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Covertype Dataset

Target: Cover_Type (Multi-class: 1 to 7)

Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas
